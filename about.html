<h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
<p>We believe that you know your job best and that we can work together to help you do your job better.</p>

<p> We have experience in both the private and public sectors covering topics such as health care, judicial systems, and
    school transportation. What’s more, is we LOVE learning about what you do and addressing the problems you’re facing
    head-on.</p>

<p>When working with our customers, we believe that communication is vital and we make every effort to keep you
   informed. For this reason, we opt for an Agile approach such as Scrum or Kanban.</p>

<p>We take an iterative approach so that you can see progress along the way, and you also have opportunity to adjust
   course as needed. We also back our development with automated tests to ensure that we avoid the “well it worked last
   week” syndrome.</p>
